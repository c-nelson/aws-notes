AWS Shield is a managed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection service that safeguards applications running on AWS. AWS Shield provides always-on detection and automatic inline mitigations that minimize application downtime and latency.

- Types of attacks
	- Network volumetric attacks (L3) - saturate capacity
	- Network protocol attacks (L4) - TCP SYN flood
		- Leave connections open to prevent new ones
	- Application Layer attacks (L7) - e.g. web request floods
- Standard
	- Free - automatic protection
	- Protection at the perimeter of the network
		- Region/VPC or Edge
	- Protects common network or transport layer attacks
	- Best protection using [R53](../../Network/R53/R53.md), [CF](../../Network/CloudFront/CF.md), [Global Accelerator](../../Network/CloudFront/Global%20Accelerator.md)
- Advanced
	- Extra cost - $3000 per month per [Organizations](../Accounts/Organizations.md)
	- 1 year commitment
	- Protects [CF](../../Network/CloudFront/CF.md), [R53](../../Network/R53/R53.md), [Global Accelerator](../../Network/CloudFront/Global%20Accelerator.md), anything associated with EIPs ([EC2](../../Compute/EC2/EC2.md)), [ALBS, NLBS](../../Network/ELB/ALB%20vs%20NLB.md), CLBs
	- Not automatic - must be explicitly enabled in Shield Advanced or Firewall Manager Shield advanced policy
	- Benefits:
		- Cost protection (i.e. EC2 scaling) for unmitigated attacks
		- Proactive engagement & AWS Shield response team will contact you when attacks are detected
	- [WAF](WAF.md) integration - includes basic WAF fees for web ACLS, rules and web requests
	- Application layer protection (uses WAF)
	- Real time visibility of events and attacks
	- Health-based detection - application specific health checks, used by proactive engagement team
	- Protections group - manage protection at a group level instead of a resource level
