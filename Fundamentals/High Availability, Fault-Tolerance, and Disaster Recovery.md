## High Availability (HA)
Aims to ensure an agreed level of operational performance, usually uptime, for a higher than normal period.

Maximize a systems uptime.

HA is not concerned with UX, it just means to minimize outages. For example, if a user has to re-login after a service is moved to a backup server, this is still HA.

## Fault-Tolerance (FT)
The property that enables a system to continue operating properly in the even of the failure of some of its components.

Continue operation after a failure without disrupting the user.

HA is just about maximizing uptime, FT is about operating through failure.

## Disaster Recovery (DR)
A set of policies, tools and procedures to enable the recovery or continuation of vital technology infrastructure and systems following a natural or human-induced disaster.

What if HA or FT don't work?

A plan to keep crucial and non replaceable components safe.
