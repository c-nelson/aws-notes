## Hosts
- [EC2](EC2.md) instances run on EC2 hosts (AWS Servers)
	- Shared Hosts
		- Default
		- Shared across AWS accounts
	- Dedicated Hosts
		- Not shared hardware
		- Just pay for the host, not instances running on it
	- Hosts run in a single [AZ](../Fundamentals/Resilience.md#AZ) #AWSCommonTest 
- Instance Store - local storage to the host
	- Temporary storage
- Storage Networking - on each host
	- Connect to the Elastic Block Store (EBS)
		- Remote storage
		- Allocate volumes
		- Runs within a single AZ
		- Can't be accessed across AZs
			- Can never connect an EC2 to a volume or another EC2 in another AZ
- Data Networking - on each host
- Instances run on a single host
	- Stay on host even after restarting
	- Changes hosts if:
		- Host fails or is taken down
		- Instance is stopped and then started, different than restarting
- Instances of different types can be on a host but
	- Generally, instances of the same type but different sizes share a host
