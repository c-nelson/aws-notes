Custom resources enable you to write custom provisioning logic in templates that [CloudFormation](CloudFormation.md) runs anytime you create, update (if you changed the custom resource), or delete stacks.

- CloudFormation doesn't support everything
- Custom Resources allow integration with anything it doesn't yet or doesn't natively support
- Passes data to something, gets data back from something
