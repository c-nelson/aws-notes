Amazon Polly is a service that turns text into lifelike speech, allowing you to create applications that talk, and build entirely new categories of speech-enabled products.

- Text to Speech
- No translation
- Standard TTS = Concatenative (phonemes)
- Neural TTS = phonemes => spectrograms => vocoder => audio
- More human sounding
- Output formats: MPC, Ogg Vorbis, PCM
- Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML)
	- Additional control over how Polly generates speech
	- Emphasis, pronunciations, whispering, "newscaster"
