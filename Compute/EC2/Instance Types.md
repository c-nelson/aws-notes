[EC2](EC2.md) Instance Types comprise of the OS and size.

Instance Types affect:
- Raw CPU, Memory, Local Storage Type & Capacity
- Resource Ratios
- Storage and Data Network Bandwidth
- System Architecture / Vendor
	- ARM, x86, Intel, AMD, etc
- Additional Features like GPUs, FPGAs

## Categories
- General Purpose
	- Default - diverse workloads
	- Equal resource ratios
- Compute Optimized
	- Media processing, scientific modeling, gaming, ML, etc
	- Latest high performance CPUs
	- Higher CPU to memory ratio
- Memory Optimized
	- Processing large in-memory datasets like some databases
	- Higher memory to CPU ratio
- Accelerated Computing
	- Additional capabilities like GPUs, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)
- Storage Optimized
	- Provide high performant local storage
	- Sequential and Random IO, transactional databases, data warehousing, elasticsearch, analytics
