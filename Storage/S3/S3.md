Simple Storage Service

Resilience: [Region](../../Fundamentals/Resilience.md#Region)

Data is stored in a specific region and never leaves that region unless configured.

S3 is a [public service](../../Fundamentals/Public%20vs%20Private%20Services.md#Public%20service).

S3 should be used as the default storage on AWS. #AWSCommonTest 

Can be accessed via: 
- UI
- CLI
- API
- HTTP

## Objects
is the data that S3 stores

Components:
- Key (similar to filename)
- Value (content in binary)
	- **Up to 5TB in size** #AWSCommonTest 
- Version ID
- Metadata
- Access Control
- Subresources

## Buckets
are containers for [Objects](#Objects).
#### Naming #AWSCommonTest 
- Bucket names need to be globally unique across all regions and accounts on AWS.
- 3-63 characters
- all lowercase
- no underscores
- start with a letter or number
- can't be formatted like an IP

#### Limits #AWSCommonTest
- Can hold unlimited objects.
- Soft limit of 100 buckets
- Hard limit of 1000, using support requests.
	- Don't use a bucket per user, divide it using prefixes.
- Unlimited objects in a bucket

S3 is an object store, not file or block.
You can't mount an S3 bucket.

Buckets are stored in a flat structure (as opposed to something like a folder filesystem). 
Folder structures are imitated using `/` in object names. `some/path/file.jpeg`.
These "folders" are therefore are often referred to as **prefixes**.
