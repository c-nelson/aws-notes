# Border Gateway Protocol

- Autonomous System (AS) - routers controlled by one entity, a network in BGP
- ASN are unique and allocated by IANA
- Operates over TCP port 179
- Not automatic - peering is manually configured
- BGP is a path-vector protocol, it exchanges the best path to a destination between peers, path is called ASPATH
- iBGP = Internal BGP - routing within an AS
- eBGP = External BGP - routing between AS's
