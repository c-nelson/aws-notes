**VPC Peering**Â enablesÂ **private, point-to-point network connectivity**Â between two [VPC](VPC.md)s, allowing instances to communicateÂ **as if they were in the same network**.

#### ðŸ”¹Â **Key Features:**

- ConnectsÂ **VPCs within the same AWS account**,Â **across accounts**, or evenÂ **across regions**Â (inter-region peering).
    
- **No gateway, VPN, or separate physical hardware**Â required.
    
- Traffic stays on theÂ **AWS global backbone**â€”**low latency**,Â **high bandwidth**, andÂ **secure**.
    

#### ðŸ”¹Â **Limitations:**

- **No transitive routing**Â â€“ VPC A peered with B, and B peered with CÂ **does not allow A â†” C**Â communication.
    
- **CIDR blocks must not overlap.**
    
- **Manually update route tables**Â in each VPC to enable traffic flow.
    
- **No DNS resolution by default**Â between VPCs unlessÂ **"enable DNS resolution"**Â is checked.
    

#### ðŸ”¹Â **Use Cases:**

- Microservices architecture with isolated VPCs
    
- Shared services VPC (e.g., central logging or authentication)
    
- Multi-account environments using AWS Organizations
    

#### ðŸ”¹Â **Setup Steps:**

1. Create aÂ **peering connection**Â (from requester VPC to accepter VPC).
    
2. Accept the connection in theÂ **target VPC**.
    
3. UpdateÂ **route tables**Â in both VPCs.
    
4. (Optional) EnableÂ **DNS resolution**Â if needed.
