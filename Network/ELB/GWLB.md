Gateway Load Balancers enable you to deploy, scale, and manage virtual appliances, such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and deep packet inspection systems. 

It combines a transparent network gateway (that is, a single entry and exit point for all traffic) and distributes traffic while scaling your virtual appliances with the demand.

- Help you run and scaled 3rd party appliances
- Inbound and outbound traffic (transparent inspection and protection)
- GWLB endpoint - traffic enters/leaves
- GWLB - balances across multiple backend appliances
- Traffic and metadata is tunnelled using GENEVE protocol

Why is GWLB needed?
