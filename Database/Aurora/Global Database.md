Aurora global databases are a feature of [Aurora](Aurora.md) Provisioned clusters which allow data to be replicated globally providing significant RPO and RTO improvements for BC and DR planning.

Up to 5 regions.

Additionally global databases can provide performance improvements for customers, with data being located closer to them, in a read-only form.

Replication occurs at the storage layer and is generally ~1s between all AWS regions.
